function [cfg] = expDesign(cfg)
    %
    % This function and its companions creates the sequence of blocks (static/motion)
    % and the events (the single directions) for MT+ and MT/MST localizers.
    %
    % The conditions are consecutive static and motion blocks (fixed in this order gives
    % better results than randomised).
    %
    % USAGE
    %
    %  [cfg] = expDesign(cfg)
    %
    %
    % Output:
    %
    % - ``cfg.design.blockNames``: cell array (nbBlocks, 1) with the condition name for each block
    % - ``cfg.design.nbBlocks``: integer for the total number of blocks in the run
    % - ``cfg.design.directions``: array (nbBlocks, nbEventsPerBlock) with the direction
    %   to present in a given event of a block.
    % - ``cfg.design.blockFixationPosition``: [MT_MST] array (nbBlocks, 1)
    %   with the position in the hemifiled where to show the fixation cross
    %    - 0 90 180 270 : indicate the angle for translational motion direction
    %    - 666 -666     : indicate in/out-ward direction in radial motion
    %    - -1           : indicates static
    % - ``cfg.design.speeds``: array (nbBlocks, nbEventsPerBlock) indicate the dots speed
    %   in each event, the target is represented by a higher/lower value
    % - ``cfg.design.fixationTargets``: array (nbBlocks, numEventsPerBlock) showing
    %   for each event if it should be accompanied by a target
    %
    % It can be run as a stand alone without inputs and display a visual example of the
    % possible design. See ``getMockConfig`` to set up the mock configuration.
    %
    % It computes the directions to display and the task(s), at the moment:
    %
    %   1. detection of change in the color of the fixation target
    %   2. detection of different speed of the moving dots
    %      [ WIP - if selected as a task it will give the same null output
    %      as if not selected ie no difference in speed ]
    %
    % EVENTS
    %
    % The ``nbEventsPerBlock`` should be a multiple of the number of motion directions requested in
    % ``motionDirections`` (which should be more than 1) for example::
    %
    %   MT localizer: ``cfg.design.motionDirections = [ 0 90 180 270 ]; % right down left up``
    %   MT_MST localizer: ``cfg.design.motionDirections = [666 -666]; % outward inward``
    %
    % Pseudorandomization rules:
    %
    % - Directions:
    %
    %   1. Directions are all presented in random orders in `numEventsPerBlock/nDirections`
    %      consecutive chunks. This evenly distribute the directions across the
    %      block.
    %   2. No same consecutive direction
    %
    % - Color change detection of the fixation cross:
    %
    %   1. If there are 2 targets per block we make sure that they are at least 2 events apart.
    %   2. Targets cannot be on the first or last event of a block.
    %   3. No less than 1 target per event position in the whole run
